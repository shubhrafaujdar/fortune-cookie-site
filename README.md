## üî• Backend Setup (Firebase)

This project uses Firebase to store and retrieve fortunes. To run it, you'll need to set up your own Firebase project.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    *   Add a new Web App to your project.

2.  **Get Firebase Config:**
    *   In your Firebase project settings, find your web app's configuration object. It will look something like this:
        ```javascript
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "...",
          authDomain: "...",
          projectId: "...",
          storageBucket: "...",
          messagingSenderId: "...",
          appId: "...",
          measurementId: "..."
        };
        ```
    *   Copy this object and paste it into the `<script>` tag at the bottom of `index.html`, replacing the placeholder configuration.

3.  **Upload Fortunes to Firestore:**
    *   In your Firebase project, enable Firestore.
    *   **Get a Service Account Key:**
        *   In your Firebase project settings, go to the "Service accounts" tab.
        *   Click "Generate new private key" and save the JSON file.
        *   Rename the downloaded file to `serviceAccountKey.json` and place it in the root directory of this project.
    *   **Install Dependencies:**
        *   Open your terminal in the project root and run:
            ```
            npm install
            ```
    *   **Run the Upload Script:**
        *   In your terminal, run the following command to upload the fortunes to your Firestore database:
            ```
            npm run upload-fortunes
            ```
    *   You can verify that the data has been uploaded by checking the Firestore data viewer in the Firebase Console.
